This application allows the user to search for books via the Google Books API. They have the ability to view book titles, authors, descriptions, links, as well as save them to their own personal list, which is viewable when the "Saved" link is clicked. They can delete books from this list as well by clicking the "Remove book" button for any book on their saved list. Any time the user saves or removes a book, it will be reflected on a MongoDB database, which is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. This application was made through MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
